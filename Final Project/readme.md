# Final Project

"The climax of this course is its final project. The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software. So long as your project draws upon this courseâ€™s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. You may implement your project in any language(s). You are welcome to utilize infrastructure other than the CS50 Appliance. All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community, or that you change the world. Strive to create something that outlives this course."<br>

## Doeet.

My project is a "bullet journal", or planner, to follow the time you spend on a task or a project, your goals, as well as the materials you're using to achieve them.

This application is implemented with Python, Javascript (Jquery), SQL and HTML/CSS, which were the languages I learnt from the classes, albeit it will potentially be a phone app, which suits its purpose better (besides that it would be the occasion to fix some of its flaws).

The project must be introduced by way of [a short video](https://youtu.be/5e4DZoM8ol8).

### To do/improve :
 - [ ] better database management (i.e.: objective as integer and not as string/pre-formatted)
 - [ ] feature: edit objective
 - [ ] sum total time spent for a task?
