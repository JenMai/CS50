Week 9 deals with implementing a mashup of Google Maps and Google News, displaying news according to location as a result.
The purpose of this exercise wasn't to write a lot of code, but being able to use an API (Google maps') and look through its documentation.

Tasks:
Understand distribution code
Implement articles() within application.py
Implement search() within application.py, supporting postal codes at least
Implement addMarker() and removeMarker() within script.js

Possible improvement: try to use SQLite's Full-text search
